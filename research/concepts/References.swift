/*
Assignment and Copy Behavior for Strings, Arrays, and Dictionaries

Swiftâ€™s String, Array, and Dictionary types are implemented as structures. This means that strings, arrays, and dictionaries are copied when they are assigned to a new constant or variable, or when they are passed to a function or method.

This behavior is different from NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary in Foundation, which are implemented as classes, not structures. NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary instances are always assigned and passed around as a reference to an existing instance, rather than as a copy.
