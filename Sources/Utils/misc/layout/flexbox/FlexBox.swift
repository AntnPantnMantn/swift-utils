//The way I understand it (Grow):
    //remainder space is key
    //grow means if there is 3 items and you want 1 to have 2 /3 of the space you set it to two and the other two to 0.5, f you set them to 1 then you get 4 sort of. THe grow should be the percentage IMO
    //shrink in conjunction with grow is hard
