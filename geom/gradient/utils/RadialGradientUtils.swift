Radial gradient:

Fill the current clipping region of `context' with a radial gradient
between two circles defined by the center point and radius of each
circle. The location 0 of `gradient' corresponds to a circle centered at
`startCenter' with radius `startRadius'; the location 1 of `gradient'
corresponds to a circle centered at `endCenter' with radius `endRadius';
colors are linearly interpolated between these two circles based on the
values of the gradient's locations. The option flags control whether the
gradient is drawn before the start circle or after the end circle.
