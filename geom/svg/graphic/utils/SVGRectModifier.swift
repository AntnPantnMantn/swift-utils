     * IMPORTANT: this method seems to only work if its in this file (spend 3-4 hours trying to debug it, i think its either xcode or the strange array system that svg uses), you could figure this out if you mimicked the svg system and only used basic classes. Like a dummy test. Then compare unitill you got it working. For now though, we need to move on
