//math related to the rectangle 
//Examples of good candidates for structures include:

//The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height property, both of type Double.
//A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and a length property, both of type Int.
//A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each of type Double.

struct Point {

//Shorthand Setter Declaration
//If a computed property’s setter does not define a name for the new value to be set, a default name of newValue is used. Here’s an alternative version of the Rect structure, which takes advantage of this shorthand notation:
struct AlternativeRect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set {
            origin.x = newValue.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newValue.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
}

//You can simplify the declaration of a read-only computed property by removing the get keyword and its braces

struct Cuboid {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0, depth = 0.0
    var volume: Double {
        return width * height * depth
    }
}
let fourByFiveByTwo = Cuboid(width: 4.0, height: 5.0, depth: 2.0)
print("the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is \(fourByFiveByTwo.volume)")
// prints "the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is 40.0"
